The baby steps for the next few months, almost hidden from consciousness:

Pushups: _practical, x pushups every other day_

x = my max limit (keeping correct form) - 2
+ break + x - 4
+ break + x - 6
+ break + x - 8

Bicycle Crunches: _"most efficient":http://www.acefitness.org/getfit/studies/bestworstabexercises.pdf_

Continued a while after a burning sensation is felt. Loose experiment to contrast with the formulaic approach of the pushup schedule.

Assorted Yoga: _for spinal mobility and general symmetry._ 

Personal experimentation with Mind/Body exercise and breathing synchronisation. Of the light variety targeting areas of concer: upper middle back and spine in general, hips+butt, shoulders, neck.

CHANGES UNRELATED TO EXERCISE

Quitting coffee: _Personal experiment relating to depression, anxiety and energy levels_

Eliminating caffeine as a possible cause of anxiety. 

Sinus rinse: _Intranasal saline solution_

Attempt to cure sinus/eye/ear problems and to regain some sense of smell.
