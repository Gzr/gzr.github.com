Appealing to plain vanilla common sense I'd imagine a good place to start would be _spinal mobility_ and strengthening _core musculature_.

Jumping into high intensity training after ten years of sedentary inactivity doesn't sound like a good idea to me; some basic poses and breathing movements from the yoga, slow deep squats etc., bicycle crunches and pushups seem like a great idea.

It's common knowledge and common practice to "warm up", here are the actual physiological benefits and their mechanisms:

* The term is literal, muscles warm up by 2 degrees celcius. Cause: exothermic chemical reactions of calory burning (replenishing fuel availability for the muscle cells)

* Muscle protoplasm viscosity decreases in the warmer environment. Means less friction for the muscle, less 'stiffness' (stiffness therefor not entirely a lack of stretchiness)

* Hemoglobin transfers oxygen more efficiently (the transfer is more energetic in the warmer environment)

* Increased heart rate delivers more blood to muscles (the cause of dizziness as blood supply to brain diminishes)

* Blood vessels dilate, increasing benefits of elevated heart rate

* Nerve impulses become more efficient for some reason

It seems therefor that if a warmup is done correctly, by the end of it I should feel looser and more energetic. Literally I should _be_ more energetic.
