A good place to start would be _spinal mobility_ and strengthening _core musculature_?

Some basic poses and breathing movements from the yoga, slow deep squats etc., bicycle crunches and pushups.

Why warm up?

* The term is literal, muscles warm up by 2 degrees celcius. Cause: exothermic chemical reactions of calory burning (replenishing fuel availability for the muscle cells)

* Muscle protoplasm viscosity decreases in the warmer environment. Means less friction for the muscle, less 'stiffness' (stiffness therefor not entirely a lack of stretchiness)

* Hemoglobin transfers oxygen more efficiently (the transfer is more energetic in the warmer environment)

* Increased heart rate delivers more blood to muscles (the cause of dizziness as blood supply to brain diminishes)

* Blood vessels dilate, increasing benefits of elevated heart rate

* Nerve impulses become more efficient for some reason

I should feel looser and more energetic.
